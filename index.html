		<h1>About Me </h1>
		
		<p>
		I'm a scientist, living in the Bronx NY. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I'd love to learn how to create beautiful websites for all the science content I'd love to write for the internet.
		</p>
		
		<h2>My Misson</h2>
		
		<p>
		As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a part time scientist, part time photographer, and part time NPR science reporter in a really great lab or science company.I'd like to work in an environment where I can set my own schedule and wear clothing made out of sweatshirt material whenever I want.
