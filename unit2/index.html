		<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
		<ol>
		<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/" target="blank">reddit</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://grinderscoffee.com.au/" target="blank">Grinders</a></li>
		</ol>

		<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size and balance?</h2>
			<p>I actually don't think Reddit makes really good use of design. They do use balance well in the sense that no one aspect of the front page outweighs the other. I hate the layout and the font, but it is inspring to me because it really shows that even in the face of shitty design, your website can still be used by millions of people.
			</p>
			<p>What inspires me about Grinders is their use of photos as the focal point. As you scroll down, balance is achieved for each section as the photos are all the same size. Even when multiple photos are used, for example towards the bottom of the page, each photo is given the same size to maintain the overall balance of the site. I don't think the heirachy is destroyed here in doing this as it makes it so that each photo has the same visual impact.
			</p>
			<p>
			I'm a huge visual person and tend to lean towards websites that make use of photos to highlight their site. 
			</p>
		<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
			<p>Besides the fact that they both have words on the pages and utilize a "scrolling down" functionality, I don't feel that they are very similar at all. However, they do both exhibit buttons at the top of the page to take you to other pages.
			</p>
			<p>
			reddit's focal points are mostly text links fashioned in a scrolling list, while Grinders uses high-res photos as their anchors. Some design elements I appreciate are the weather icon on the top right, and the coffee icons under "how to make".
